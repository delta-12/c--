# autocompile
This is the directory that contains the autocompile feature for c++ source code.  Just place your source code into the source directory within the directory that corresponds to the OS for which the program was written.  The binary will appear in the bin directory also within the directory that corresponds to the OS for which the program was written.

Currently, only compiling for Windows and Linux is supported.

Support for OSX coming soon!
