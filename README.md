# c--

This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous c++ source code as well as precompiled binaries

# Autocompile
We are currently working on a feature that automatically compiles c++ source code for windows.  In the autocompile directory, there is a directory named Windows.  Within that directory, there are a source and bin directories.  To use the autocompile feature, place c++ source code in the source directory and in 1-5 minutes the source code will be compiled in a .exe binary that will be placed in the bin directory.
