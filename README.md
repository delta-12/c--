# c--
This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous c++ source code as well as precompiled binaries

# Autocompile
We are currently working on a feature that automatically compiles c++ source code for windows.  In the autocompile directory, there is a directory named Windows.  Within that directory, there are a source and bin directories.  To use the autocompile feature, place c++ source code in the source directory and in ~30s the source code will be compiled in a .exe binary that will be placed in the bin directory.

Note: This feature is still in beta testing.

# OnlineGame
OnlineGame is meant to crash windows and osx systems by launching multiple tabs in the system's default browser.
