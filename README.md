## Announcements
The Autocompile feature now supports compiling c++ source code for Linux as well!

## Autocompile
**_You must be a collaborator to use this feature!_**

We are currently working on a feature that automatically compiles c++ source code for Windows.  In the autocompile directory, there is a directory named Windows.  Within that directory, there are source and bin directories.  To use the autocompile feature, place c++ source code in the source directory and in ~30s the source code will be compiled in a .exe binary that will be placed in the bin directory.  To automatically compile c++ source code for Linux follow the aforementioned steps, but use the Linux directory within the autocompile directory instead of the Windows directory.  The compiler for Linux is setup to support the readline library as well.

Support for OSX coming soon!

Note: This feature is still in beta testing.  Also, you may have to refresh your browser in order to view the new binary.

## OnlineGame
