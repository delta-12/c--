## Autocompile
**_You must be a collaborator to use this feature!_**

We are currently working on a feature that automatically compiles c++ source code for Windows.  In the autocompile directory, there is a directory named Windows.  Within that directory, there are source and bin directories.  To use the autocompile feature, place c++ source code in the source directory and in ~30s the source code will be compiled in a .exe binary that will be placed in the bin directory.  Support for linux and OSX coming soon!

Note: This feature is still in beta testing.  Also, you may have to refresh your browser in order to view the new binary.  Support for Linux and OSX coming soon!

## OnlineGame
